\-	*You see, Ethan...you father he…well not here ok? They can cancel the parole…you know, right? Your father, yes, your father, I can explain, let’s just…go out first…* - Broke down Ralph in some sort hysteria mixed with fear

Ethan seemed to ponder for some seconds, as if kill the fragile man or not was actually a natural option; until finally placing back the gloves, and regaining the previous shown calm – *Let’s get out of here, drive me to the Garage, I need to grab some things and cross the river* – firmly concluded Ethan

\- *But, the Parole, you can’t leave the country just yet…*

\- *Ralph…* - interrupted Ethan without altering his voice, making the bald layer go pale once again;

\- *Thank you* – surprisingly concluded Ethan as he left the room carrying his huge backpack in one of his shoulders.
