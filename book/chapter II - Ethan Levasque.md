**Chapter II – Ethan Lévesque**

__*Dorchester Penitentiary – New Brunswick CA -  6 months ago…*__

The silence was absolute in the room absent of furniture if not for a metal table and two rough chairs, no windows and just one exit – a camcorder set in a tripod the only vigilant of the tall muscular young man sitting alone in the sterile interrogation room, his figure, perfectly immobile, face covered by a dark green hood carefully set to hide his eyes, being the only discernable trait his obvious young age, as his chin was barely covered by beard, even though the last years in prison weren’t gentle on him, one would say no more than 20…maybe 22 years old.

No less carefully placed, and as much as odd was the heavy gloves covering his cuffed hands immobilized behind his back, tying him to the chair.

\- *Let the circus begin…* - whispered Ethan without noticeably moving his lips, that together had no expression, forming a tight line above his unshaved chin, in the next second, contrasting perfectly with Ethan figure and behavior, A short, bald man, loud and effusive suddenly made his way into the room, noisily slamming the door behind his back:
\- *Right on boy! You’re out!* – said the semi-bald layer in a high pitched tone
\- *I knew 11 months of good behavior would take you out, and well, it surely hasn’t killed ya, you will be on the streets today!*
\- *But two years in this S\*%# Ralph…you took two years* – answered Ethan without changing tone, a pinch louder than a whisper.
\- *where are my things?* -  Continued Ethan – *I want every single thing I had on me when they brought me to this pig house* –
\- *Oh, all here boss! Said Ralph dropping an old camping backpack over the metal table producing a loud bang, making Ethan expression twist in visible pain.*

\- *I’m sorry buddy, ok…sorry* – the bald man rushed to correct himself as he rapidly removed the handcuffs from Ethan, that even with free hands didn’t cared to rid himself from the odd looking heavy leather gloves he had on; instead he calmly stood from the chair as he slid the hood off his head, revealing a light brown straight hair, that immediately fell to his face partially covering his eyes once again;

His square shaped features, apart from the never changing hostility was symmetric and beautiful in a very uncommon way, Even the hair with no defined cut seemed to form a good frame for his deep black eyes, but as a whole, the figure of that young man inspired something terrible, like the feeling of one while in the presence of a wild animal, unpredictable, uncontrollable…

\- *Where is it? where is the damn key?! do not test me vermin* – said Ethan while removing one of the gloves, revealing twisted claw shaped nails, about 4 centimeters long, tinged in yellowish color, that reminded pestilence, disease, death…
