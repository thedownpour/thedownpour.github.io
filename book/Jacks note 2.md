**Jack’s Note II – *Present Day***

Yeah…Its Jack – I hope you guys will have the guts to read this note until the end, it’s not the best of my days; actually things are getting harder by the hour and this is really getting into me… In case any of you took the time to care, no…she isn’t here…she was supposed to be by now, but Meg never made it…I stood there as the crowded passed through me, countless hours, so much that I’ve seen the sun come up to warm the cold glass panels of the Domodedovo airport – For security reasons she could not tell me the exact flight she took, or was supposed to take from America to Russia, so I made sure to wait all night long… I made sure to come back and hide here with the heaviest of the feelings in my chest; and now the bottom of my nauseated stomach writes this letter, not Jack – Jack is half dead somewhere inside…

I can only pretend nothing happened, and that she will turn up sooner or later, but a thing I cannot do is suppress this sense of protection I developed for Meg… our age difference is just two years, being her the youngest of us, but to me she is just a child; she cannot control or understand what she is. What we are…And how deep is the feeling of looking ourselves in the mirror and see we are no longer humans…our old lives; farther away in the past, more at every glance we give at our damaged skin, reminder of the price of survival.

I turned very early… far too early, I did my time learning to suffer, and I kept hopping I could spare people I care, People like Meg from the same suffering… Yeah, I hope she will just turn up once of these days…write a letter one of this days…Jack will remain Half dead, waiting…through all of these days.

I am afraid this is not the only bad news I have to share, as tragic as it was; I hope that what I will let you guys know will at least serve to open some eyes about how close of your doors all of this crazy S\*\#% is…

One of the hardest things for us; and when I say us I mean non-Humans… is to cover distance without attracting unwanted attention, both from your kind and the other two that shares this world, a lot of effort and a lot of people work hard to create a network, a trust network only to provide safe access to our hidden cities and… ok… ok… wait;

I am getting over my head and by doing so I will end up blowing yours: The second born has its cities built literally bellow your noses.

We have surface villages but our great centers are underground cities, the exact location of these I cannot tell, but it will be priceless to see the face of you all when you come to find out…

Anyway, back to the subject: The Moscow Metro is to us the greatest hub of transport in Moscow, just like it is to any common muscovite (of course I mean…Humans Muscovites) but travel through is not as simple as buy a ticket and punch our way in.

Today one of the Key figures of this very needed structure fell…Both Russian and western news outlets covered up the death of Anton, he was a supervisor at the Moscow Metro, and head of a chain that provided us safe passage and usage of the underground tunnels linked direct to our cities or other destinations around Moscow, apparently he was walking a few of us past the security of the Metro and through the tunnels, when his chest was ripped open in a blink of an eye…by a Shade…not an ordinary one, an old breed, well trained assassin.
